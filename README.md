# timer-chrome-extension
A repository containing the code that goes into making a chrome extension. I will be making a chrome extension that allows the user to track the passing of time.

## Requirements
- Be downloadable on the Chrome Web Store
- Have an appealing design
- Allow user to start, pause and stop a timer with the use of 3 buttons
- display the amount of time passed since the timer was started
- allow the user to detail what they were doing during the duration of the timer
- allow the user to store the time session and description, to view later

For now I will focus on the first 4 features
